## Description

The Simon Game is a classic electronic memory game that challenges players to repeat a growing sequence of colors and sounds. Originating from the 1978 arcade game by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison, Simon has become a beloved game for all ages.

## How It Works

1. **Gameplay**:
   - The game board consists of four buttons, each with a different color (typically red, green, blue, and yellow) and corresponding sound.
   - The game begins by lighting up one of the buttons and playing its sound.
   - The player must press the lit button to repeat the sequence.
   - With each round, the game adds an additional step to the sequence.
   - The player must remember and reproduce the entire sequence in the correct order.

2. **Objective**:
   - The goal is to correctly repeat the sequence of lights and sounds for as long as possible.
   - As the sequence lengthens, it becomes more challenging, testing the player’s memory and concentration.
   - The game ends when the player makes a mistake in the sequence.

3. **Difficulty Levels**:
   - Some versions of the game offer different difficulty levels, which may affect the speed at which the sequence is displayed or the complexity of the patterns.

4. **Scoring**:
   - Points are awarded for each correct sequence.
   - The longer the sequence, the higher the score.

## Features

- **Engaging Gameplay**: Simple yet challenging gameplay that improves memory and cognitive skills.
- **Visual and Auditory Feedback**: Each button produces a unique color and sound, enhancing the sensory experience.
- **Progressive Difficulty**: As the sequence grows, the challenge increases, keeping the game engaging.
- **Multiplayer Option**: Some versions of Simon offer a multiplayer mode, allowing players to compete for the highest score.
